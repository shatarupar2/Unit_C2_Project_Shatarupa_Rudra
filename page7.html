    <h2>File Paths</h2>
    <h3>What is a file path?</h3>
    <p>A file path is the written route a computer will use to locate a file.</p>
    <h3>Different types of file paths</h3>
    <p> The <b>absolute file path</b> uses the full path, starting from the root of the file. It states the full location of the file from beginning to end, no matter where you are in the system</p>
    <pre>An example of this would be: 
            <b>/home/ILOVECODE/projects/index.html</b>
    </pre>
    <p>The <b>relative file path</b> uses the currect file being worked on in order to locate the file without much effort. It references files that are located within the same directory or subdirectory of the current folder, without stating the full path of it.</p>
    <pre>An example of this would be:
            <b>./index.html</b>
   </pre>

   <p>The image shows an example of a file path system.
   </p>
